Hello Bell Badminton Shuttlers,

Happy New Year! Hope everyone had a nice relaxing holiday!

A friendly reminder that badminton resumes on **Friday, January 10, 2025**.

#### **<u>Cancelled Dates (No badminton)</u>**
Please note the following dates have been cancelled by the school board due to holidays or school events and there are no badminton on these days:
- February 14, 2025
- March 14, 2025
- April 11, 2025

#### **<u>Pickleball</u>**
Quite a few members have expressed interest in using part of the gym for pickleball on Fridays.

After discussing this idea amongst the board members, we have decided to give pickleball a try from 6:00 p.m. to 7:00 pm. when the gym is usually quieter.

We will be using courts 3 and 6 during this one hour period for any members who wish to play pickleball or learn how to play this new sport. 
We will provide the balls and will have a few spare paddles for people to try. 
This will be a great opportunity for any member who wished to try this new sport, but never had the opportunity to learn.

Please note the club's priority is still badminton. If we find that pickleball is interrupting the play of badminton, we will revert back to full-time badminton play.

#### **<u>No Scent Environment</u>**
A friendly reminder that the club fosters a no scent environment. Please refrain from wearing any scented products to the gym, as some of our members have allergies.
Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Thank you,
Bell Badminton Club
