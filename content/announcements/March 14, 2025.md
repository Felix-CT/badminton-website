Hello Bell Badminton Shuttlers,

Just a friendly reminder that there will be no badminton this Friday, March 14, 2025 due to March break.

We will resume play on Friday, March 21, 2025.

Unfortunately, the school has cancelled another session on March 28, 2025 due to a school event. Therefore, there will also be no badminton on this day.
