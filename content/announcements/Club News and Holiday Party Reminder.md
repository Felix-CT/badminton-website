Hello Bell badminton shuttlers,

Just a friendly reminder that Friday, December 20, 2024 will be the last session for this year. The club will be closed during the holiday season and will return on January 10, 2024.

#### **<u>Holiday Party</u>**
Reminder that we will be hosting our holiday party on **December 20, 2024** inside the gym.
Refreshments and finger food will be provided.
We will also be doing a raffle for gifts, where everyone present will receive a gift. To receive your gift, you must be **present in-person**. The draw will take place at 8:00 p.m.
Hope everyone will be able to join us on this day to celebrate.

#### **<u>Group Photo</u>**
We would like to retake our club photo this Friday. It will be great if everyone could wear their club shirt. Please note participation in the group photo is not mandatory; however, your 
participation in the photo is your consent for media release to having your picture published on our website.

#### **<u>No Scent Environment</u>**
A friendly reminder that the club fosters a no scent environment. Please refrain from wearing any scented products to the gym, as some of our members have allergies.
Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Thank you,
Bell Badminton Club
