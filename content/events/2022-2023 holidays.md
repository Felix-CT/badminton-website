Hi to all badminton members, 

Happy New Year first of all. 

Hope you are all having a good year so far

And also included, are the photos taken during our Christmas “Open House” badminton session on December 22th. Special thanks to ***Justin*** and ***Eveline*** who helped with the decorations and to Cindy who made and decorated the beautiful badminton cake. It was very delicious!    

Thanks also to all of you who were very patient with the large number of guests we had during that evening. It was a great success! Many players manifested their gratefulness and thankfulness during the evening.   

Hope to see you all on Friday. 

Denis
