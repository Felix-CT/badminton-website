<p>Time sure flies when we are having fun! We can’t believe two months have already gone by since we started the season.
Here are a few updates as we head into the busy holiday season:</p>
<h4><strong><u>Additional Gym Cancellations</u></strong></h4>
<p>Unfortunately, we have recently been notified by the school board that the following days have been cancelled due to school events:</p>
<ul>
<li>April 11, 2025</li>
<li>May 30, 2025<br><br></li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><u>Holiday Party</u></strong></h4>
<p>We will be hosting a holiday party on <strong>December 20, 2024</strong> inside the gym.
Refreshments and finger food will be provided.
We will also be doing a raffle for gifts, where everyone present will receive a gift. To receive your gift, you must be <strong>present in-person</strong>. The draw will take place at 8:00 p.m.
Hope everyone will be able to join us on this day to celebrate.</p>
<h4><strong><u>Club Website</u></strong></h4>
<p>We are working on a new website for our club. The website is <a href="https://www.bellbadmintonclub.ca">www.bellbadmintonclub.ca</a>. The site is still under construction, but all play days and cancellations can be found under the calendar page.</p>
<h4><strong><u>Coaching Volunteers</u></strong></h4>
<p>If you or anyone you know is interested in volunteering to provide a few coaching lessons to our juniors and beginner adults, please reach out to us to discuss.</p>
<h4><strong><u>No Scent Environment</u></strong></h4>
<p>A friendly reminder that the club fosters a no scent environment. Please refrain from wearing any scented products to the gym, as some of our members have allergies.
Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
<p>Thank you,
Bell Badminton Club</p>
